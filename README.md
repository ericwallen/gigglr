# Gigglr - Advertising Network Platform

A modern advertising network platform built with Svelte, powered by [`sv`](https://npmjs.com/package/sv).

Gigglr provides a comprehensive solution for managing advertising campaigns, content channels, and advertiser relationships.

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Everything inside `src/lib` is part of the Gigglr platform library, everything inside `src/routes` provides the main advertising network application.

## Building

To build your library:

```sh
npm pack
```

To create a production version of the Gigglr platform:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.

## Publishing

Go into the `package.json` and give your package the desired name through the `"name"` option. Also consider adding a `"license"` field and point it to a `LICENSE` file which you can create from a template (one popular option is the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)).

To publish your library to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```sh
npm publish
```
